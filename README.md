# Link Diver

Link Diver is a chrome extension to speed up understanding the links that can be extracted from web pages, which is a complicated task in modern websites that make heavy use of anchoring and javascript in a sophisticated layout. The main goal is to make it easier for a human to “dive” into web sites just like a web crawler. This should greatly help to efficiently identify patterns in outlinks, problematic URLs, and in general the path that a hypothetical web spider would follow through a website.
